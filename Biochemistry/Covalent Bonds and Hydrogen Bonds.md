- Forces
	- Covalent Bonds
		- Sharing electrons
		- EX: methane CH<sub>4</sub> 
		- Length of a covalent bond is 0.15-0.2 nm
		- Covalent bonds don't break on their own under physiological conditions
			- 83 kcal/mole to break C-C a
			- Vibrational mode of a covalent bond at 25 C is about 0.6 kcal/mole
		- bend, rotate, and stretch
		- single, double, and triple
			- more is stronger
			- double and triple bonds are unsaturated and **can't rotate**
		- Chirality
			-  Optical isomers - cannot be converted between one another without breaking bonds
				- At a molecular level much of biology relies on interaction of complementary 3D surfaces
				- No way to get a right hand into a left glove
		- Sharing of Electrons
			- Non polar bonds have equally shared electrons
			- Polar bonds have unequally shared electrons
			- Electronegativity - How greedy an atom is for an electron
			- EX: in O-H, electrons spend more time by O
			- Use δ to denote.
		- Join monomers to form biological polymers.
		- Strongest kind of bond in biological molecules
	- Hydrogen Bonds (H Bond)
		- Made possible by δ<sup>-</sup> (O, N) and δ<sup>+</sup> (H) in a polar bond.
		- Important for proteins, nucleic acids, and carbohydrates.
		- 1/20 the strength of a covalent bond, which means that some energetic molecules in the body can break these bonds.
		- Hold together strands of DNA (like molecular velcro)
		- Prevents things from dissolving in water.
	- Ionic Bonds
	- Van der waals bonds
	- Hydrophobicity
- Biomolecules
	- Carbohydrates
	- Proteins
		- Enzymes - Biological catalysts that enable specific bonds to be broken or formed **under physiological conditions** 
	- Nucleic Acids
	- Lipids
