- Biomolecules are often macromolecules
	- They are often polymers (but not always)
- Polymers are molecules consisting of repeating monomers
- Condensation reactions form bonds between monomers
	- m-OH + OH-m -> m-O-m + H<sub>2</sub>O
- Hydrolysis reactions break bonds between monomers
	- m-O-m + H<sub>2</sub>O -> m-OH + OH-m
- Many of the reactions within biochemistry involve condensation and hydrolysis reactions
- Often these reactions require energy but  sometimes they release it.

## Lipids
- A class of macromolecule and essential for life
- 5% of the dry mass of a cell
- Crucial for cell and organelle membranes
- Serve as energy stores for the cell because their bonds contain a lot of energy
- Involved in cell signaling processes
- Insulation
	- Keeping the organism warm during winter
	- Insulating nerve cells (like a wire)
- Condensation reactions with lipids often synthesize triglycerides
	- Formed from glycerol

	- Also a transesterification
		- Ester bond formed in triglyceride 
- Lipids are not strictly polymers (Not like the other macromolecules)
- Triglycerides are very nonpolar molecules
- Lipids can be modified by replacing one of the fatty acid chains with something that is polar.
	- This is primarily done in phospholipids
	- Add a phosphate group

- Phosphate head is hydrophilic and polar
- Carbon tails are nonpolar and hydrophobic.
- Form lipid bilayers spontaneously (membrane)
	- Nonpolar tails face inside towards each other
	- Polar heads face out
	- THIS IS A SINGLE MEMBRANE - A DOUBLE MEMBRANE HAS TWO OF THESE (EX: mitochondria or nucleus)
	- This is what all cell and organelle membranes look like
- There are different kinds of triglyceride chains
	- Saturated fats - The carbon chains have all single bonds and are completely filled with hydrogen
		- Pack tightly - Chemical stability and a high melting point (Solid) (Bad for you)
	- Unsaturated fats - Have a double bond at some location in the carbon chains
		- Cis - Carbons are stuck to each other because the bonds that are available are on the same side. Double bonds cannot rotate so if it is synthesized like this cannot be changed
		- Trans -
