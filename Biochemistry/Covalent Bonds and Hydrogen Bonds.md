- Forces
	- Covalent Bonds
		- Sharing electrons
		- EX: methane CH<sub>4</sub> 
		- Length of a covalent bond is 0.15-0.2 nm
		- Covalent bonds don't break on their own under physiological conditions
			- 83 kcal/mole to break C-C a
			- Vibrational mode of a covalent bond at 25 C is about 0.6 kcal/mole
		- bend, rotate, and stretch
		- single, double, and triple
			- more is stronger
			- double and triple bonds are unsaturated and **can't rotate**
			- Chirality
				- Optical isomers - cannot be converted between one another without breaking bonds
					- At a molecular level much of biology relies on interaction of complementary 3D surfaces
					- No way to get a right hand into a left glove

		- Enzymes - Biological catalysts that enable specific bonds to be broken or formed **under physiological conditions** 
	- Nucleic Acids
	- Lipids
